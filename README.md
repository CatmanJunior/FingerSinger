# FingerSinger

## Overview
FingerSinger is an innovative project that transforms the unique patterns of fingerprints into distinct sounds, creating a personalized musical experience. This project leverages a fingerprint scanner to capture prints and convert them into sound data. This sound data is then written onto an NFC (Near Field Communication) chip. The magic happens on the dancefloor designed to function as a drum sequencer. By placing the NFC chip on a tile, it assigns a beat of the sequencer to the sound and illuminates the tile, adding a unique touch to the musical and dance experience.

## Features
- **Fingerprint-to-Sound Conversion**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to convert the ridges and patterns of fingerprints into sound.
- **NFC Chip Integration**: Encodes the generated sound onto an NFC chip for easy transportation and interaction.
- **Interactive Dancefloor**: A specially designed dancefloor that reads NFC chips, plays back the encoded sounds, and lights up, creating an immersive musical experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Fingerprint scanner compatible with the project's specifications.
- NFC writer to encode sound onto chips.
- NFC-enabled interactive dancefloor setup.
- Software dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/CatmanJunior/FingerSinger.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Follow the hardware setup guide for the fingerprint scanner and NFC writer in the `docs` directory.

### Usage
1. Run the FingerSinger application.
2. Place your finger on the fingerprint scanner to capture your fingerprint.
3. The application will convert your fingerprint into a unique sound and encode it onto an NFC chip.
4. Place the NFC chip on the interactive dancefloor to play the sound and see the corresponding tile light up.
